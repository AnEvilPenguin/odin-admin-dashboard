## Project Synopsis

The aim of this project is to implement an admin dashboard using a basic brief and design document.
The aim is to put into practice all of the concepts around laying out dynamic content into a single 'dashboard' mock-up.

## Learning objectives

The main objective here is to put together everything that has been taught around structuring a webpage to cement previous lessons.
A secondary objective is to make the page more responsive. We don't necessarilly need to make it truely responsive, but it should react to changing desktop displays well.
